## HW10; Score: 20/20

DeVaughn and Jane, I am really seeing how this coming together and what you plan to do. You have a detailed plan and it looks very good. It's a bit ambitious, but I think you two can handle it. I think you have distributed the workload to speak to your strengths. I'm glad to see that you are starting to write you code. I'm hoping that you comment on it inline, so I can review it in more detail. Great job this week!
