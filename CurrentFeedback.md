DeVaughn and Jane, It looks like you made some progress this week on writing your code. I'm wondering about the output of it. I can read it and it appears to do what you suggest it does, but I'd really like a plot of the data that it produces to understand where you are going with it. I'll also push that you make sure to explain the details of the model that you are using and the details of the methodology that you are using to explore the model (on your poster of course). It will be important to explain that so that people understand what you have done.
