## HW12; Score: 16/20

DeVaughn and Jane, I really appreciate the coneptual figures that you have developed. I think they really help people understand what you are trying to model. I would push you to link these to the histogram (or whatever you choose to present you work). That is, how are they connected. What parameters are being included and modeled, etc. I also wonder about optical depth. Your histogram appears, but it is unclear if it is, for a single optical depth. The second conceptual figure you have is really nice to communicate what happens at different optical depths (if you can model that). I would like to see what you have planned for the poster at some point because figures are only one aspect of the poster, so if you want to do that formally, please do, but also feel free to ask me to just check out the repository when you want some quick feedback.
