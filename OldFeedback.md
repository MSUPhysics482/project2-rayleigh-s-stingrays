DeVaughn and Jane, I think the project that you have proposed looks very cool. I'm excited to see the model(s) that you will be working with and I'm hoping there's some details in the work that you turn in for Monday. I do wish there were a more detailed timeline and how the work will be distributed between the two of you, so I'll be looking into the reflection questions that you answer over the course of the project for this.

Jane and DeVaughn, this could be a very cool project. I'm worried that the scope might be a little too ambitious for what I'm asking you to do, but it definitely hits all the criteria for a good project. So, feel free to scale back a bit, if it's feeling like you are spending way too much time on one aspect. Overall, this is going to be an interesting project, I think.
