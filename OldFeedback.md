DeVaughn and Jane, It looks like you made some progress this week on writing your code. I'm wondering about the output of it. I can read it and it appears to do what you suggest it does, but I'd really like a plot of the data that it produces to understand where you are going with it. I'll also push that you make sure to explain the details of the model that you are using and the details of the methodology that you are using to explore the model (on your poster of course). It will be important to explain that so that people understand what you have done.

DeVaughn and Jane, I am really seeing how this coming together and what you plan to do. You have a detailed plan and it looks very good. It's a bit ambitious, but I think you two can handle it. I think you have distributed the workload to speak to your strengths. I'm glad to see that you are starting to write you code. I'm hoping that you comment on it inline, so I can review it in more detail. Great job this week!

DeVaughn and Jane, I think the project that you have proposed looks very cool. I'm excited to see the model(s) that you will be working with and I'm hoping there's some details in the work that you turn in for Monday. I do wish there were a more detailed timeline and how the work will be distributed between the two of you, so I'll be looking into the reflection questions that you answer over the course of the project for this.

Jane and DeVaughn, this could be a very cool project. I'm worried that the scope might be a little too ambitious for what I'm asking you to do, but it definitely hits all the criteria for a good project. So, feel free to scale back a bit, if it's feeling like you are spending way too much time on one aspect. Overall, this is going to be an interesting project, I think.
