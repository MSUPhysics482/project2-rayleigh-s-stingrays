## HW8; Score: 20/20

Jane and DeVaughn, this could be a very cool project. I'm worried that the scope might be a little too ambitious for what I'm asking you to do, but it definitely hits all the criteria for a good project. So, feel free to scale back a bit, if it's feeling like you are spending way too much time on one aspect. Overall, this is going to be an interesting project, I think.
